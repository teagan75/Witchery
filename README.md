# Witchery
RPG style tutorial

You find yourself in the foreign land of Barovia where the sun never shines. A mysterious realm surrounded by a deadly fog. You don't know how you got here, but you can feel the presence of an ancient evil.

This pack will teach players the Witchery mod without the need for multiplayer or a PvP server. It is map and quest based and uses NPCs (excluding quest npcs) as targets for the players' choices: good or evil. The story is heavily based on Dungeons and Dragons' The Curse of Strahd and feels like a 1930s Dracula movie. The quests are linear in the beginning and eventually become more sandbox-like offering two paths. 

When you first load up the pack, you will need to download the map using the link on the load screen.

This pack is currently in alpha state. So, if you play it, please report issues here.
